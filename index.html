            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Rimma and I'm young professional software developer with strong communication skills.
            Three years ago i moved from Russia to fulfill my dream in America.
            My biggest goal is to make people lives easier and joyful. Through software my dream comes true.
            There moments as  a software developer when you are locked on a specific problem and time stops but in the end
            there nothing more satisfying than solving it.</p>
